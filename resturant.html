           <h3>OUT DOOR RESTURANT</h3>
           <p>Pine City Resturant is the perfect outdoor restaurant for those who want to feel like they’ve escaped the city while remaining in it. A lovely nursery offers a perfect excuse to do some plant shopping, but also provides the perfect setting for a chilled outdoor meal. Gia’s burgers, made with freshly baked buns and home-made 250g pure beef patties, are well renowned. Try the Lazy Afternoon (cheddar, avo and bacon), the Ayoba (double patty, cheddar, tomato and onion), or the Pluck Pluck chicken burger. All burgers come with fries or salad, or half/half.</p>
          <p><strong>WILL YOU FIND IT?</strong></p>
